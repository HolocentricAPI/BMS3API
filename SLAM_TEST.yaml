      # Overview
      Holocentric Modelpedia now supports API that is based on OData style interface and data structure. 
      
      This API can be used by third party applications to retreive data from Modelpedia. The API supports a single RESTful service that can return the schema of a queried library. Additionally you can also retreive related items and relationships for a queried item type. 
      
      API access is performed over HTTPS and accessed from a variable URI based on client installations and libraries. 
      
      This document is aimed at helping you work with this API functionality in Modelpedia.
      # Prerequisites
      
      - The API license key needs to be uploaded to the server.
      - The SSL certificate needs to be installed for the API.
      - The user making the API requests needs to be assigned the System Authority Role `Repository Administrator` and the role `API Client (Full Read)`.
      
      # Licensing
      
      A separate API license key is required to be installed in Modelpedia before a published library can be accessed via the exposed API.
      
      API callers are required to be authorized Modelpedia users and therefore follow standard subscription licensing model.
# The tags on paths define the menu sections in the ReDoc documentation, so
# the usage of tags must make sense for that:
# - They should be singular, not plural.
# - There should not be too many tags, or the menu becomes unwieldly. For
#   example, it is preferable to add a path to the "System" tag instead of
#   creating a tag with a single path in it.
# - The order of tags in this list defines the order in the menu.

  # Primary objects
  - name: "Authentication"
    x-displayName: "Authentication"
    description: |
        Holocentric BMS uses OAuth for the service authentication. This authentication mechanism requires an initial call to authenticate the API user based on the user name and password provided, and will then return an access token.
        
        The token that is received can then be used for subsequent API requests.
        
        Please note the following:
        
        - The access token has a default expiry time of 8 hours.
        
        - Subsequent requests for a token within the 8 hour expiry period will not expire existing valid tokens.
        
        - Tokens must not be shared; only the requesting IP address can use the token provided.
